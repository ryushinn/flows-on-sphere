# Overview
This is a Pytorch implementation of [[2002.02428\] Normalizing Flows on Tori and Spheres (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02428) by Rezende et al. 

All 3 flows on spheres MS, EMP, and EMSRE are implemented, and the Table.1 results have been reproduced. 

This is another great and helpful [JAX attempt](https://github.com/katalinic/sdflows) I refered though the experiment of (N=24, K=1) fails in their case.
